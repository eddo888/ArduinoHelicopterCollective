Please see this excellent work from M Heironimus

git@github.com:MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary.git

Here I setup Arduino Leonardo with micro joystick to drift trim axis for x and Y which hold at setting, with a button to reset to neutral. 

Has rudder, toe brakes and a throttle.

Includes a collective with a lock switch to hold it in place electronically. 

Also has a canopy on/off SPST switch generating temporary buttons for transitions from on->off and off->on
